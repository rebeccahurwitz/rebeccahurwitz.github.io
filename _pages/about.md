Hello! My name is Rebecca - thank you for visiting my website! 
<br><br>
I am a PhD student in Biomedical Data Science at Stanford University on an IvyPlus Exchange for the 2025-2026 school year in the Department of Biostatistics at Harvard University. I am very fortunate to be advised this year by <a href="https://hsph.harvard.edu/profile/brent-coull/">Brent Coull</a>. Previously, I completed my SM in Biostatistics at Harvard and my BA in Integrative Biology at UC Berkeley.
<br><br>
My research interests lie at the intersection of statistical learning, environmental health, and health equity. I am particularly interested in estimating the effects of environmental mixtures and am passionate about applying statistical methods to real-world health problems. Under Dr. Coull, I am working on extending Bayesian and kernel-based methods to study multi-pollutant mixtures, time-varying exposures, and survival outcomes, with applications in the NHS and GUTS cohorts. My broader background spans machine learning for health, genomic data analysis, environmental health, and algorithmic fairness. I also care deeply about teaching and mentorship, having served as a Teaching Fellow and tutor in several biostatistics courses.
<br><br>
Outside of school and work, you can probably find me outside in nature, doing puzzles and trying new food with friends, or (poorly) competing in intramural sports!
