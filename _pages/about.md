Hello! My name is Rebecca - thank you for visiting my website! 

I am a PhD student in Biomedical Data Science at Stanford University on exchange for the 2025-2026 school year in the Department of Biostatistics at Harvard University. I am very fortunate to be advised this year by <a href="https://hsph.harvard.edu/profile/brent-coull/">Brent Coull</a>. Previously, I completed my SM in Biostatistics at Harvard and my BA in Integrative Biology at UC Berkeley.

My research interests lie at the intersection of statistical learning, environmental health, and health equity. I am particularly interested in estimating the effects of environmental mixtures and passionate about applying statistical methods to real-world health problems.
