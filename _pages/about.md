Hello! My name is Rebecca - thank you for visiting my website! 

I am a PhD student in Biomedical Data Science at Stanford University on exchange for the 2025-2026 school year in the Department of Biostatistics at Harvard University. I am very fortunate to be advised this year by <a href="https://hsph.harvard.edu/profile/brent-coull/">Brent Coull</a>.
